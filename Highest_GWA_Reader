# Write a Python program that read a file containing the name of 20 students together with their GWA.
# The program will outputs the name of the student who got the highest GWA (including the GWA).

# install pyfiglet
import pyfiglet
print("Welcome!")

# ask the user to continue
answer = input("Are you ready? (Yes or No): ")

if answer == "Yes":
    print("Yes, here it is!")  # or do something
elif answer == "No":
    print('You answered No.')  # or do something else
else:
    print(f"Your answer can only be Yes or No. You answered {answer}")

# create banner
ascii_banner = pyfiglet.figlet_format("CONGRATULATIONS!")
print(ascii_banner)

    # open file named students.txt(read)
    with open('students.txt', 'r') as students:
